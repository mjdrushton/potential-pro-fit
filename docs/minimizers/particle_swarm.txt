Particle_Swarm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Type-Name: Particle_Swarm
:Description: Minimizer based on Inspyred's PSO minimizer.

Algorithm Description
=====================

Particle swarm optimiser.


.. note::
  This minimizer wraps the PSO implementation provided within the `inspyred library <http://inspyred.github.com>`_ . If you use this minimizer please acknowledge inspyred. The approach used by the optimizer was described in [Deb and Padhye]_ please recognise their work if you make use of the Particle_Swarm minimizer.
  


Optional Fields
===============

:Name: cognitive_rate
:Arg-type: float
:Default: 2.1
:Bounds: >0.0
:Description: The rate at which the particle's current position influences its movement. 

\

:Name: inertia
:Arg-type: float
:Default: 0.5
:Bounds: >0.0
:Description: Inertia constant to be used in particle updating.

\

:Name: max_iterations
:Arg-type: int
:Default: 1000
:Description: Terminate optimisation after this number of iterations.

\

:Name: neighbourhood_size
:Arg-type: int
:Default: 3
:Bounds: >2 and < population_size - 1
:Description: Number of neighbours for each particle when ``topology`` is set to ``ring``.

\

:Name: population_size
:Arg-type: int
:Default: 64
:Bounds: >=2
:Description: Size of population.

\

:Name: random_seed
:Arg-type: int
:Default: current time
:Description: Random seed used during optimisation.

\

:Name: social_rate
:Arg-type: float
:Default: 2.1
:Bounds: >0.0
:Description: The rate at which the particle's neighbors influence its movement.

\

:Name: topology
:Arg-type: str
:Options: 'star' or 'ring'
:Description: Defines the neighbours of particles in the population. If 'star' then each particle is connected to all other particles. If 'ring' then all particles within a specific neighbourhood size are connected (set using the ``neighbourhood_size`` configuration option).
