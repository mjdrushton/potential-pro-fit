Evaluators
##########

Evaluators are responsible for extracting values from a job's output. Typically the difference between a property's value predicted for a particular set of candidate potential parameters is compared with a desired value, such as an experimental value. Evaluators return large values when the goodness of fit between the predicted and desired properties are poor and smaller values when a better solution is obtained.

Evaluators are attached to jobs meaning that evaluator configuration should appear in ``job.cfg`` files. Evaluator configuration blocks have the following basic format::

	[Evaluator:EVALUATOR_NAME]
	type : EVALUATOR_TYPE
	...

Each block starts with ``[Evaluator:EVALUATOR_NAME]`` where ``EVALUATOR_NAME`` is a label used to refer to the evaluated values produced by this evaluator and is used within the :ref:`pprofitmon` and by :ref:`pprofit-metaevaluators` to identify each evaluator. For this reason each block needs to have a unique ``EVALUATOR_NAME`` for a particular job (although names can be re-used within different jobs).

``type : EVALUATOR_TYPE`` identifies the evaluator to be applied to job output following completion. Several evaluators are provided with Potential Pro-Fit and they can be selected by setting ``EVALUATOR_TYPE`` to their name. The ``type`` field is then followed by fields specific to each evaluator, these are documented with respect to each evaluator below.

.. _pprofit-evaluators-DLPOLY_STATIS:

DLPOLY_STATIS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Type-Name: ``DLPOLY_STATIS``

:Description: Evaluator for extracting property time averages from the STATIS files created by the `DL_POLY <http://www.stfc.ac.uk/CSE/randd/ccg/software/DL_POLY/25526.aspx>`_ molecular dynamics code.

By default the evaluator takes the average of a property value over an entire STATIS file and returns the weighted root mean squared difference between this average and a desired value. If the :ref:`start_time <pprofit-evaluators-DLPOLY_STATIS-start_time>` field is specified, then the average will be taken from this time to the end of the STATIS file.

.. _pprofit-evaluators-DLPOLY_STATIS-fielddescription:

Field Descriptions
------------------

The general format of ``DLPOLY_STATIS`` fields is::

	FIELD_NAME : EXPECTED_VALUE [WEIGHT]

:``FIELD_NAME``: Name of field to define (e.g. ``engcns``)
:``EXPECTED_VALUE``: Desired field value. RMS difference will be calculated as root of squared difference between this value and the average extracted from ``STATIS`` file.
:``WEIGHT``: The RMS difference between extracted and expected values is multiplied by ``WEIGHT`` to obtain the merit-value for the evaluator record. ``WEIGHT`` is optional and if not specified, a value of 1.0 will be used.

Field definition example
""""""""""""""""""""""""
To fit to a volume of 1000.0 and give it a weight of 5.0 the following could be used:: 

	volume : 1000.0 5.0

Example
-------
The the following example could be to create and evaluator named "DL_POLY" within a ``job.cfg`` file. This is suitable for fitting to a volume of 1000.0 and cell angles of 90.0, 60.0 and 120.0 degrees. Note the weight on the volume has been used to bring its merit-values into a simlar range as those for the cell angles::

	[Evaluator:DL_POLY]
	type   : DLPOLY_STATIS
	volume : 1000.0 0.1
	alpha  : 90.0
	beta   : 60.0
	gamma  : 120.0

Gulp
^^^^

:Type-Name:  ``Gulp``
:Description: Parses values from output of the `GULP <https://projects.ivec.org/gulp/>` simulation code.

GULP is a powerful simulation code allowing various types of simulation run to be performed. This evaluator extracts values from GULP output. In common with other evaluators most fields take the form::

	FIELD_NAME : EXPECTED_VALUE [WEIGHT]

See description :ref:`above <pprofit-evaluators-DLPOLY_STATIS-fielddescription>` for detailed explanation of ``FIELD_NAME``, ``EXPECTED_VALUE`` and ``WEIGHT``.

.. note::

	Although a single GULP input file can contain multiple input structures, this evaluator will only extract values from the output of the first of these configurations.


Required Fields
---------------

:Name: filename
:Arg type: string
:Description: Name of file within job directory containing GULP output.
:Example: If your job's ``runjob`` script directed Gulp output into ``output.res`` you would use the following field definition:

\ 

:Name: lattice_energy
:Description: Final system energy following optimisation.

\ 

:Name: negative_phonon_penalty
:Description: Evaluates to 1.0 if negative phonon frequencies are detected. Otherwise returns 0.0. This field is useful for imposing a penalty to systems that yield unphysical negative phonon frequencies.
:Notes: Ensure that the GULP ``phon`` keyword is specified in GULP input.
:Example: Apply a penalty of 100.0 when negative phonons detected:

	``negative_phonon_penalty : 100.0``

\ 

:Name: optimisation_penalty
:Description: Evaluates to 1.0 if energy minimisation ends with a status other than "Optimisation achieved". Otherwise returns 0.0. This field is useful for imposing a penalty to systems that :may fail to optimise but may otherwise yield good, if spurious, matches to expected propety values.
:Example: Apply a penalty of 100.0 (i.e. multiply bad optimisation value of 1.0 by weight of 100.0) when optimisation run fails:

Gulp_DRV
^^^^^^^^

:Type-Name: ``Gulp_DRV``
:Description: Parses cell and atom derivatives from .drv files generated by GULP ``output drv ...`` command. Fitting to derivatives can greatly speed merit-value evaluation as it can avoid structural optimisation steps.


.. note::

	In order for the ``Gulp_DRV`` evaluator to work, make sure that your GULP file uses the ``prop`` keyword on its first line which triggers a derivative calculation. Further, make sure your GULP input file contains a command dumping a .drv file (e.g. ``output drv out.drv``).

Required Fields

	``cell_xz``

	``cell_xy``
:Description: Calculates root-squared difference between individual components of cell derivative matrix and zero. Value provided as input to these fields is weighting factor.
:Example: ``cell_xx 10.0``. Fit to cell derivative acting along x-axis and give value a 10.0 weighting factor.

Regex
^^^^^

:Type-Name: ``Regex``
:Description:  Extracts values from output files based on regular expression patterns.


Required Fields
---------------

:Name: ``filename``
:Description: Name of file from which to extract values.


Regular Expression Fields
-------------------------

The general form regular expression fields is (square brackets represent optional fields)::

	EVALUATED_VARIABLE_NAME : /REGEX/ EXPECTED_VALUE [WEIGHT [MATCHGROUP[:FILE_INSTANCE]]]


Where:

	* ``EVALUATED_VARIABLE_NAME`` : Name of extracted value as it appears to meta-evaluators and the fitting monitor.

	* ``REGEX`` : Regular expression. The python regular expression engine is used see `python regular expression documentation <http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html>`_ for details on valid expressions. The regex should contain at least one capturing group. On a match, the group is converted to a floating point value.

	* ``EXPECTED_VALUE`` : Value with which matched value will be compared. In order to form merit value, weighted RMS difference between ``EXPECTED_VALUE`` and matched value is used.

	* ``WEIGHT`` : Weighting to be applied to RMS difference with ``EXPECTED_VALUE``. Default: 1.0.

	* ``MATCHGROUP`` : Integer giving the number (starting at 1) of the regex capture group to be used for match. By default ``MATCHGROUP = 1``.

	* ``FILE_INSTANCE`` : Integer giving the number (starting at 1) of times the regular expression should match file contents before an evaluator record is generated. So a value of 2 would indicate that the second instance of a match should be used as the evaluator value. By default ``FILE_INSTANCE = 1``.


Examples
""""""""

To create an evaluator record named ``A`` that would match lines beginning ``VARIABLE:`` returning the value after the ``:`` and expecting a value of 10.0, the following evaluator could be defined for an output file named ``output.txt``::

	[Evaluator:regex] 
	type : Regex
	filename : output.txt
	A : /^VARIABLE: (.*)/ 10.0


To additionally specify a weighting factor of 2.0 the following could be used::

	[Evaluator:regex] 
	type : Regex
	filename : output.txt
	A : /^VARIABLE: (.*)/ 10.0 2.0

Within the following example, the regular expression contains two capture groups, to use the value within the second group this could be specified::


	[Evaluator:regex] 
	type : Regex
	filename : output.txt
	A : /^VARIABLE: (.*?) (.*)/ 10.0 1.0 2


To find the second occurence of this regular expression then the evaluator definition could be modified as follows::

	[Evaluator:regex] 
	type : Regex
	filename : output.txt
	A : /^VARIABLE: (.*)/ 10.0 1.0 2:2
